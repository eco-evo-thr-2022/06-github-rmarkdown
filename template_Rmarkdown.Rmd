```{r}

print("hello world")

Running this code will reproduce part of our Hill numbers exercise from last week:

```{r}
songs_data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/05-simple-metrics/hill/song_plays.csv")

head(songs_data)

library(ggplot2)

ggplot(songs_data, aes(rank, plays)) +
  geom_line()


```


The rest of last week's script is available online at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eco-evo-thr-2022/05-simple-metrics/main/hill_from_class.R

You can copy-paste code from there to practice modifying and rendering code in RMarkdown! Here's an empty code block to get you started:

```{r}


```
